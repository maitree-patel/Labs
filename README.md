# RandomDNASequenceGenerator
1. Write code to print to the console 1,000 randomly generated DNA 3 mers (e.g. “ACA”, “TCG”) where the frequency of A,C,G and T is 25% and is uniformly sampled.
2. Have your code track how often it prints out the 3 mer (“AAA”). How often would you expect to see this 3mer by chance?  Is Java’s number close to the number that you would expect?
3. Modify your code so that the frequency of A,C,G and T is
   p(A) = 0.12
   p(C) = 0.38
   p(G) = 0.39
   p(T) = 0.11
   What is the expected frequency now of “AAA”?  Does Java produce “AAA” at close to the expected frequency?
   
   Additionally, Modify your code and test code to work on protein sequences so that random sequences are generated with the background frequency of proteins in SwissProt: https://web.expasy.org/protscale/pscale/A.A.Swiss-Prot.html
   
   How do you test your (or AI code) to make sure that protein sequences match the expected background levels?
