# RandomDNASequenceGenerator
1. Write code to print to the console 1,000 randomly generated DNA 3 mers (e.g. “ACA”, “TCG”) where the frequency of A,C,G and T is 25% and is uniformly sampled.
2. Have your code track how often it prints out the 3 mer (“AAA”). How often would you expect to see this 3mer by chance?  Is Java’s number close to the number that you would expect?
3. Modify your code so that the frequency of A,C,G and T is
   p(A) = 0.12
   p(C) = 0.38
   p(G) = 0.39
   p(T) = 0.11
   What is the expected frequency now of “AAA”?  Does Java produce “AAA” at close to the expected frequency?
